<p>LoginCommand allows you to execute commands when players join your server.</p>
<h2><strong>Concept</strong></h2>
<p>The plugin uses command groups. Each group can have a number of commands. If a player has the corresponding permission node for a command group, those commands will be executed when he/she joins the server.</p>
<p>The commands are executed from the console. You can also execute player commands by adding the "sudo %name_of_player%" prefix to a command.</p>
<p>You can set a delay.</p>
<p>You can set a cooldown.</p>
<p>If you want some players to be ignored (regardless of other permissions), you can do that by giving them a permission node.</p>
<h2><strong>Setup instructions</strong></h2>
<h3>1. Download the plugin.</h3>
<h3>2. Copy the plugin into your server's plugin folder.</h3>
<h3>3. Start the server.</h3>
<h3>4. Create a command group and add commands to it.</h3>
<p>Let's say that we want to give Helpers a diamond pickaxe as an award when they join the server. We come up with a group name, "helpergifts" to store these commands.</p>
<p>The generalized command to add a command is:</p>
<pre>/logincommand add &lt;new group name&gt; &lt;command&gt;</pre>
<p>In this case:</p>
<pre>/logincommand add helpergifts give %name_of_player% diamond_pickaxe</pre>
<h3>5. Give somebody the permission of the command group.</h3>
<p>Now we have to give the permission group "Helpers" a certain permission node.</p>
<p>In case you use PermissionEx, the command might look like this:</p>
<pre>/pex group Helper add logincommand.group.helpergifts</pre>
<h3>6. Further configuration:</h3>
<p>You can find some more settings (command delay, cooldown, whether op's are exempt) in the configuration file. After making changes, issue the <strong>/logincommand reload</strong> command.</p>
<h2><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the plugin doesn't work:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - Make sure that the player doesn't have the exempt permission node. See the <strong>Permissions</strong> section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - On default settings, operators are exempt. If you want the plugin to affect them, set the value of "ops exempt" to "false" in the configuration file, then issue the <strong>/logincommand reload</strong> command.</p>
<h2><strong>Commands</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Root command and aliases:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /logincommand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /lic<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /lc</pre>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reload the configuration file:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; /lc reload</pre>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add a command to a command group; (also auto-creates the group):</p>
<pre>        /lc add &lt;group&gt; &lt;command&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove a command from a command group:</p>
<pre>        /lc remove &lt;group&gt; &lt;command&gt;</pre>
<h2><strong>Placeholders</strong></h2>
<p>When you add a command and specify a placeholder, the placeholder will be replaced on every execution with its corresponding value.</p>
<p>Valid placeholders are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of the player who joins the server:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %name_of_player%</pre>
<h2><strong>Permissions</strong></h2>
<pre>logincommand.admin<br />    description: Allows you to edit and reload the config. <br />    default: operators<br /><br />logincommand.exempt<br />    description: The plugin will ignore your login.<br />    default: Nobody, but if you have the * permission node (for example, your Admin group has it), Bukkit will report that you have this permission as well. Use negative permission nodes to counteract this.<br /><br />logincommand.group.&lt;group&gt;<br />    description: Group specific permission for command execution.<br />    default: nobody</pre>
<h2><strong>Example config</strong></h2>
<pre>execution delay (sec): 1<br /> login cooldown (min): 60<br /> configversion (don't change): 2<br /> ops exempt: true<br /> # when the above is true, operators will be ignored<br /> config:<br /> &nbsp; group1:<br /> &nbsp; - sudo &lt;name&gt; warp woods<br /> &nbsp; helper:<br /> &nbsp; - eco give &lt;name&gt; 10<br /> timestamps (auto generated): []</pre>
<p>The effects:<br /> Players who have the logincommand.group.group1 permission will be teleported to warp woods after 1 second of their joining, if their last login was more than 60 minutes ago.<br /> Players with the logincommand.group.helper permission will be given 10 units of money (the same delay and cooldown applies).</p>
